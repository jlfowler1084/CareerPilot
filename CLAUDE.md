# CLAUDE.md — CareerPilot Project Context

## Project Identity

CareerPilot is a Python CLI application for personal career management:
- Gmail scanning for recruiter emails with Claude-powered classification and response drafting
- Google Calendar integration for availability checking and interview scheduling
- Job search automation via Indeed/Dice with application tracking
- Interview transcript analysis and mock interview coaching
- Skill gap tracking with Claude-powered study roadmap generation
- Progress journaling with weekly insights and momentum analysis

**Owner:** Joe
**Location:** `F:\Projects\CareerPilot\`
**Platform:** Windows 10, Python 3.8+ (Microsoft Store Python 3.8.10)

---

## Environment

- **OS:** Windows 10/11
- **Shell:** PowerShell 5.1+ / bash (via Git Bash or WSL) — Claude Code uses bash syntax
- **Python:** 3.8+ (Microsoft Store Python 3.8.10 — use `python -m pip install` not bare `pip`)
- **Python compat:** Use `from __future__ import annotations` in all modules with type hints — `list[str]` syntax requires 3.9+
- **Node.js:** v24.14.0 (installed at `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`)
- **MCP config:** `.mcp.json` in project root (NOT settings.json)

Use `python -m pip install` for package installs — bare `pip install` may target a different Python installation.

Temp files may be cleaned up quickly by Windows — save diagnostic outputs to persistent locations (e.g., the project's `data/` or `logs/` directory), not system temp folders.

### MCP Fallback Strategy

The Atlassian MCP server for Jira may disconnect mid-session. Follow this escalation:
1. Try MCP tools first (1 attempt)
2. If MCP fails, immediately fall back to direct Jira REST API:
   ```python
   import requests, base64, os
   auth = base64.b64encode(f"{os.environ['JIRA_EMAIL']}:{os.environ['JIRA_API_TOKEN']}".encode()).decode()
   headers = {"Authorization": f"Basic {auth}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
   response = requests.get("https://jlfowler1084.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/SCRUM-XX", headers=headers)
   ```
3. Do NOT retry MCP more than once — it wastes entire sessions
4. Jira project: SCRUM on jlfowler1084.atlassian.net, transition ID 41 = Done

---

## Testing

### Test Commands

- Run all tests: `python -m pytest tests/`
- Run a specific test file: `python -m pytest tests/test_scanner.py`
- Run with verbose output: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- NEVER report "no regression" without actually running the test suite

After ANY code change:
1. Run `python -m pytest tests/` against all test cases
2. If any test fails, STOP — diagnose before attempting another fix
3. Never stack multiple fixes without testing between each one
4. Report test results BEFORE telling the user "fix confirmed"

### Regression Prevention

Before implementing any fix:
1. Analyze which other modules could be affected
2. List the specific functions that will change and the regression risks
3. Run the full test suite to establish a clean baseline BEFORE editing code

After implementing any fix:
1. Run the full test suite
2. If any module regresses, STOP — diagnose before attempting another fix
3. Never stack multiple fixes without testing between each one
4. Report test results with pass/fail counts before declaring "fix confirmed"

## Code Conventions

### Python

- Use `click` for CLI interfaces — `cli.py` is the main entry point
- Use `Rich` for terminal UI (tables, panels, progress bars, markdown)
- Include `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards in all runnable modules
- Use `logging` module, not bare `print()`, for status output
- On Windows, reconfigure stdout/stderr to UTF-8 when output may be captured:
  ```python
  if sys.platform == 'win32':
      sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
      sys.stderr.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
  ```
- Resolve file paths relative to script location using `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`
- Use `python-dotenv` to load `.env` — all config via `config/settings.py`
- SQLite for local data (applications, skills, interview analyses) — database at `data/careerpilot.db`
- Google OAuth tokens stored in `data/` directory, auto-refreshed on expiry

### General

- All paths configurable via `config/settings.py` — reference paths relative to project root
- When generating code, produce **complete working files**, not fragments
- When modifying existing files, show specific changes with surrounding context
- Timezone: `America/Indiana/Indianapolis` (EST, no DST — Indiana is always Eastern)

---

## Key Components

### config/settings.py

Loads `.env` and exposes all config values as module-level constants:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Anthropic API key
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` — Google OAuth
- `GMAIL_SCOPES`, `CALENDAR_SCOPES` — Google API scopes
- `DB_PATH` — SQLite database path (default: `data/careerpilot.db`)

### CLI Commands (Click)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `python cli.py scan` | Scan Gmail + display recruiter emails, respond/decline/skip |
| `python cli.py calendar` | Show availability for next 5 days |
| `python cli.py journal new` | Create a new journal entry |
| `python cli.py journal list` | Show recent entries |
| `python cli.py journal insights` | Weekly summary via Claude |
| `python cli.py skills` | Show skill inventory with gap visualization |
| `python cli.py roadmap` | Generate study roadmap via Claude |
| `python cli.py search` | Run job search profiles |
| `python cli.py tracker` | Show application pipeline (kanban) |
| `python cli.py tracker stats` | Search/application analytics |
| `python cli.py interview analyze <file>` | Analyze interview transcript |
| `python cli.py interview mock` | Interactive mock interview |

### API Integrations

| API | Purpose | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude) | Email classification, response drafting, gap analysis, interview coaching, roadmap generation | API key in `.env` |
| Gmail API | Inbox scanning, draft creation, email sending | OAuth2 (InstalledAppFlow) |
| Google Calendar API | Availability checking, event creation | OAuth2 (InstalledAppFlow) |
| Indeed (via MCP) | Job search | MCP server |
| Dice (via MCP) | Job search | MCP server |

### Claude API Pattern

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()  # reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="...",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
)
```

### SQLite Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `applications` | Job application tracking (status, dates, notes) |
| `skills` | Skill inventory (name, category, current/target level) |
| `interview_analyses` | Stored interview analysis results for trend tracking |

---

## External Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | Claude API SDK |
| `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-auth-httplib2` | Google OAuth2 |
| `google-api-python-client` | Gmail and Calendar API client |
| `python-dotenv` | Load `.env` config |
| `rich` | Terminal UI (tables, panels, progress bars) |
| `click` | CLI framework |
| `pytest` | Test framework |

---

## MCP Servers

MCP configuration lives in `.mcp.json` at the project root — **not** in `settings.py` or `.claude/settings.json`.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | Installed | v24.14.0 at `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` |
| npx | Installed | `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd` (bundled with Node.js) |

No global npm packages required — servers are fetched via `npx -y` on first use.

### Context7 (`@upstash/context7-mcp`)

Provides up-to-date library documentation and code examples. Use when working with any third-party library to get current API docs rather than relying on training-data approximations.

### Atlassian MCP

Connects to Atlassian Cloud (Jira, Confluence) via the official hosted MCP endpoint. Authenticates via browser OAuth on first use each session.

**Fallback if unavailable:** Update Jira tickets manually via browser or use direct REST API.

---

## API Cost Governance

**Rules for ALL outbound API calls.**

Before writing, modifying, or adding ANY outbound API call (Anthropic, Google, MCP, Supabase edge functions, or third-party), you MUST:

### Check alternatives first (in this order):

1. Can this be done with a direct MCP server call (no AI intermediary)?
2. Can this be done with a direct REST API call?
3. Can this be done with rules-based logic (regex, keyword matching, lookup table)?
4. Can this be done with cached/precomputed results?
5. If AI is genuinely needed, can Haiku handle it?
6. Only use Sonnet if the task requires multi-step reasoning, nuanced generation, or complex analysis.
7. Only use Opus for critical planning tasks with high stakes.

### Document the call

Add/update an entry in `dashboard/docs/api-registry.md` with:
- Route or function path
- Target service and model (if AI)
- Purpose (1 sentence)
- Trigger (what fires this call)
- Justification for model choice (if AI)
- Estimated cost per call

### Use environment variables for model strings

Never hardcode model names. Use:
- `process.env.MODEL_HAIKU` for classification, extraction, simple relay
- `process.env.MODEL_SONNET` for reasoning, generation, complex analysis
- `process.env.MODEL_OPUS` for critical multi-step planning (rare)

### Error handling is mandatory

Every API call must have try/catch with:
- No silent retries that could double-bill
- Graceful degradation (show cached data or a clear error, don't retry in a loop)
- Rate limit awareness (back off, don't hammer)

### Never use Claude as an MCP relay

If the goal is to call an MCP tool and return its results, call the MCP server directly. Claude should only be in the path if it needs to **reason** about the results.

### Model selection quick reference

| Task Type | Model | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Classification (< 5 categories) | Haiku | Email categorization, job relevance scoring |
| Data extraction (structured) | Haiku | Pulling fields from text, topic tagging |
| Simple text generation | Haiku | Short summaries, status labels |
| Complex reasoning | Sonnet | Interview prep, cover letter drafting, pattern analysis |
| Nuanced generation | Sonnet | Resume tailoring, reply drafting with context |
| Multi-step planning | Opus | Architecture decisions, complex workflow design |
| Data relay / search | NO AI | Job search via MCP, API lookups, CRUD operations |

---

## Claude Code Model Selection

### Auto-Detect Rule

At the START of every task, before doing any work, evaluate the task complexity and output a model recommendation:
📊 Model recommendation: [HAIKU | SONNET | OPUS]
Reason: [one-line justification]

If the current session model is higher than needed, say so. If it's lower than what the task requires, warn immediately so the user can switch before work begins.

### Model Tiers

**HAIKU — Use for:**
- File renaming, moving, copying, simple reorganization
- Find-and-replace across files (mechanical changes)
- Env var substitution (replacing hardcoded strings)
- Adding boilerplate (auth guards, error handlers, imports)
- Simple grep/search tasks and reporting
- Linting, formatting, or fixing syntax errors
- Updating documentation with known facts
- Running tests and reporting results
- Git operations (commit, push, branch, merge)
- Any task where the instructions are fully specified and require no judgment

**SONNET — Use for:**
- Writing new features or components with business logic
- Refactoring code that requires understanding architecture
- Debugging non-obvious issues (requires reasoning about state/flow)
- Writing or modifying API routes with complex request/response handling
- Designing data models or database schemas
- Writing tests that require understanding intent and edge cases
- Code review and suggesting improvements
- Multi-file changes that need to stay internally consistent
- Prompt engineering for AI-powered features
- Any task that requires reading context, making decisions, or generating non-trivial code

**OPUS — Use for:**
- Architecture design across multiple systems
- Complex multi-step planning with dependencies
- Analyzing and redesigning entire subsystems
- Tasks requiring deep reasoning about tradeoffs
- Critical production changes with high stakes
- Full codebase audits (like the cost audit)
- Writing design docs that require synthesizing many sources

### Prompt Convention

When writing prompts, include a model hint at the top:
```
[HAIKU] Add Supabase auth guards to search-indeed and search-dice routes.

[SONNET] Refactor the email classification pipeline to support batch mode.

[OPUS] Audit all 28 API call sites and produce a cost optimization report.
```

If no hint is provided, default to SONNET (safe middle ground). If the task turns out to be simpler or more complex than expected mid-execution, note the mismatch.

### Decision Shortcuts

Ask yourself: "Does this task require Claude to THINK, or just DO?"
- Just DO → Haiku
- Think then do → Sonnet
- Think deeply about many things, then plan, then do → Opus

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't hardcode absolute paths — everything goes through `config/settings.py`
- Don't add Python dependencies without calling them out — update `requirements.txt`
- Don't use bare `pip install` — use `python -m pip install`
- Don't recommend rewriting working components in a different language/framework without clear reason
- Don't overwrite MCP config files (e.g., `.mcp.json`) — always merge new entries into the existing object
- Don't restructure config schema without discussion
- Don't stack multiple code fixes without running the test suite between each one
- Don't report "no regression" without actually running pytest
- Don't retry failed MCP connections more than once — fall back to REST API immediately
- Don't assume temp files still exist — Windows may clean them up
- Don't send emails without explicit user approval — Gmail responder starts in draft-only mode

---

## Git Workflow

**Repo:** `jlfowler1084/CareerPilot` (private)
**Branch:** `master` (default working branch)
**Remote:** `origin` → GitHub

### Standard workflow for all code changes:

1. **Pull before starting work:** `git pull origin master` to ensure you're on the latest
2. **Make changes** — edit files as needed
3. **Stage and commit** with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: description of what changed"
   ```
4. **Push to remote:** `git push origin master`

### Commit message conventions:

- `feat:` — new feature or capability
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — code restructuring, no behavior change
- `docs:` — documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, README, comments)
- `chore:` — maintenance (dependencies, config, cleanup)
- `test:` — adding or updating tests

### Rules:

- **Every task that modifies project files should end with a commit and push.** Don't leave uncommitted changes.
- **Never commit** files matching `.gitignore` patterns: `data/`, `*.db`, token files, `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `.claude/settings.local.json`
- If a task involves multiple logical changes, use **separate commits** for each
- Before starting any work session, run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes from previous sessions

---

## Privacy & Safety

- **Draft-only mode:** The Gmail responder saves drafts — nothing sends without explicit user approval
- **All data stays local:** SQLite database + markdown files. Nothing leaves the machine except API calls to Google and Anthropic
- **OAuth tokens:** Stored locally in `data/` directory, never committed to git
- **API keys:** Stored in `.env`, never committed to git

---

## Things to Avoid

- **Don't suggest cloud services** for features that work locally unless specifically asked
- **Don't auto-send emails** — always draft first, require explicit approval
- **Don't store API keys in code** — always use `.env` and `config/settings.py`
- **Don't skip OAuth token refresh** — always handle expired tokens gracefully
- **Don't break the CLI** — all features accessible via `cli.py` commands

---

## Current Priorities

Phase-based development roadmap:
1. Phase 1 — Gmail recruiter scanner + response drafting (1a: scanner, 1b: responder)
2. Phase 2 — Google Calendar integration (availability + scheduling)
3. Phase 3 — Journal system + skill gap analysis
4. Phase 4 — Interview transcript analysis + coaching
5. Phase 5 — Job search integration + application tracker
6. Phase 6 — Unified dashboard CLI + daily workflow
